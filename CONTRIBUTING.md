# Contributing

The point of this repo is to get better every project. Two rules keep it healthy.

## 1. Gotchas are the gold
When a build surprises you, capture it in the right `skills/<skill>/references/gotchas.md`
in this exact shape:

```
## <short title>
Symptom: <what you saw>
Cause: <verified reason>
Fix: <what worked>
Do NOT: <the trap>
```

Only add CONFIRMED findings. "Probably" belongs in a PR discussion, not in gotchas.

## 2. Keep the shape
- `SKILL.md` body stays concise (~180–450 tokens). Detail → `references/`. Code → `assets/`.
- Frontmatter needs `name`, `description` (with trigger words first), `license`,
  `metadata.author`, `metadata.version`.
- The orchestrator never gains CSS/HTML/PHP. Execution lives in skills.
- Builder-agnostic knowledge goes in `ux-design-system`; builder-specific execution in
  `elementor-core` / `divi-core`.

## Workflow
```
git checkout -b <type>/<short-name>     # gotcha/side-cart-trap, feat/build-home, fix/…
# edit
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>: <summary>"       # conventional commits, no AI attribution
git push -u origin <branch>
# open a PR
```

## Versioning
Bump `metadata.version` in a skill's frontmatter when its contract changes. `divi-core`
stays < 1.0 until its path is validated end-to-end on a real site.

## Testing a change
Install locally (`install.ps1` / `install.sh`), run the orchestrator against a throwaway
NovaMira site, and confirm `qa-review` passes with server-side evidence before merging.
